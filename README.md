# Endless Tower of Fracta

This is an example of a simple idle rpg made with react

# Demo

# To start the project locally

npm start

# Gameplay

Press the start button to start the game. To start the fight press
the "Fight" button. Each second the game will compare your stats
with the stats of the enemy and show the result. If your health
goes to 0 - you will lose. If the health of the enemy goes to 0 -
you will win and move to the next screen. On the next screen, you
will be asked to Lvl up your skills. The idea is to create a
well-balanced character, who can fight against any enemy.
Aftherwards you will be moved to the next stage, and the process
repeats.
